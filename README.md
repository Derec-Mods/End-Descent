# End Descent

A minimal, configurable plugin that safely returns players from the End back to the Overworld (or a configured fallback world) when they fall into the void or trigger a teleport event. In other words, falling in the void will drop you straight into the sky of the Overworld!

Designed to be simple, server-friendly, and compatible with vanilla behavior while providing configurable safety, particle transitions, and sane defaults. Inspired by FunkyToc's datapack of similar function.
